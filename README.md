- 👋 Hi, I’m @yashpal-byte — a backend brain with an AI twist. I love designing efficient systems, debugging logic, and connecting the dots between backend engineering, data, and intelligence. I’m always refining — whether it’s my code, my workflow, or the way I think about solving problems.
For me, tech isn’t just about tools — it’s about building things that make sense, scale well, and stay smart.
Where code meets curiosity — and efficiency always wins.

- 👀 I deep dive into Data and BI engineering & AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently master at Python, SQL, PowerBI.
- Just seeded into  Backend engineering (java + springboot).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open source in Java and Python.
